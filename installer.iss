[Code]
{ The in-app update runs this installer silently, from the app, just before the app closes.
  The app is a one-file bundle: two processes run MasterPDF.exe (a small launcher, and the
  app itself), and they need a moment to exit. If the installer goes ahead while they're
  still running, the file can't be replaced and a silent install quietly fails (and the
  "close running apps" step can leave the launcher stuck, holding the file). So before any
  file is touched: wait for Master PDF to close by itself, and end whatever is still running
  after that - it's a leftover of the app that asked for this update. }

{ True while the installed .exe is still open (the app, or its launcher, running): the very
  thing that stops it from being replaced. Tested directly - can it be opened exclusively
  for writing? - rather than by looking for the process by name. }

  app) passed its "your files are unpacked in my temp folder" variables down to this installer,
  and they'd reach the new version that [Run] starts too - which would then look for its files
  in the old app's temp folder (deleted by now) and never start. This tells PyInstaller to
  ignore them and start fresh (it only affects programs started from this installer). }
